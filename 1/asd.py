I am a very curious, creative and analytical thinker with a passion for technology.

I am self-motivated, I have been learning through online lectures the general principles of software development and have quite a broad level knowledge of the most popular languages. More specifically I have been learning how to use Python, Django, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a website for a personal project (still in production). I've had a lot of fun with it so far, especially since python is such a forgiving language.

I am a skilled communicator and love to discuss technical/scientific ideas with my friends and family in a way that draws interest and that is tailored to their level of knowledge, rather effusing an outpour of obscure data.
Good communication should be easy to understand, using the right amount of detail without losing sight of the bigger picture in my opinion

I love problem-solving and will stick with an issue until it's solved, working independently and using creative and critical thinking to see problems from all angles until I arrive at a (number of) solution(s).

I am very eager to learn the more in-depth intricacies of software development, and excited at the possibility of becoming a developer.
